\title{Do some minor error fixing}
\usage{
fixErrors(x, targetFile, attemptErrorFixes = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Any object that could be fixed for errors.
See \code{\link{fixErrors.SpatialPolygons}}}

\item{targetFile}{Character string giving the path to the eventual file
(raster, shapefile, csv, etc.) after downloading and extracting from a zip
or tar archive. This is the file \emph{before} it is passed to
\code{postProcess}. Currently, the internal checksumming does not checksum
the file after it is \code{postProcess}ed (e.g.,
cropped/reprojected/masked). Using \code{Cache} around \code{prepInputs}
will do a sufficient job in these cases.}

\item{attemptErrorFixes}{Will attempt to fix known errors. Currently only some failures
      for SpatialPolygons* are attempted. Notably with \code{raster::buffer(..., width = 0)}.
      Default \code{TRUE}, though this may not be the right action for all cases.
@examples}

\item{...}{None used currently}
}
\description{
These must be very common for this function to be useful. Currently, the only
meaningful method is on SpatialPolygons, and it runs \code{rgeos::gIsValid}. If
\code{FALSE}, then it runs a buffer of width 0.
