\title{This is a very fast version of cir with allowOverlap = TRUE, allowDuplicates = FALSE,
returnIndices = TRUE, returnDistancse = TRUE, and includeBehaviour = "excludePixels".
It is used inside spread2, when asymmetry is active. The basic algorithm is to run cir
just once, then add to the xy coordinates of every locus}

.cirSpecialQuick(landscape, loci, maxRadius, minRadius)
