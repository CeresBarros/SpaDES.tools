## Updated release

This release fixes CRAN concerns about package declarations for tests and vignettes.

**This update depends on the latest version of `reproducible` (v0.2.0) which we have just submitted to CRAN.**

The maintainer email address has changed, about which I notified CRAN on March 28, 2018 and sent followup on June 12, 2018 (in response to `fpCompare` submission) and again on June 15, 2018 (in response to `SpaDES` submission).

We also introduce several new functions, and update previous functions (see NEWS.md).

2. Some words were flagged as possibly mispelled, but they are false positives:

    Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:

## Downstream dependencies

We have run R CMD check on downstream dependencies, and all have passed except those noted below.
Summary at https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.tools/blob/master/revdep/README.md.

* `SpaDES` and `SpaDES.core` produce an error due to a non-CRAN package in Suggests, but passes once that dependency is installed.
