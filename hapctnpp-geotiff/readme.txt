DATA FORMATS

The spatial data are provided in GRID (zipped ArcInfo workspaces) and 
compressed GeoTIFF formats. The grids are stored in geographic coordinates 
with the following parameters:

Projection: 	Geographic
Spheroid:	WGS84
Units:		Decimal Degrees

The grids have a resolution of one-quarter degree (0.25 decimal degrees), 
or approximately 28 km on a side at the equator.
 
Three spatial data products are available:

1) Global Patterns in Net Primary Productivity (NPP)  
- ArcInfo GRID values are stored in grams of carbon per grid cell. The
file name is npp_grid
- GeoTIFF values are stored in millions of grams of carbon per grid cell. 
The filename is npp_geotiff.tif

2) Global Patterns in Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity 
(HANPP) 
- ArcInfo GRID values are stored in grams of carbon per grid cell. The 
file name is hanpp_grid
- GeoTIFF values are stored in millions of grams of carbon per grid cell.
The file name is hanpp_geotiff.tif

3) Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity as a Percentage of 
Net Primary Productivity 
- ArcInfo GRID and GeoTiff values are both stored as HANPP as a % of NPP
per grid cell. The file names are, respectively, hapctnpp_grid and 
hapctnpp_geotiff.tif


In addition, one tabular data product is available in Excel Workbook 
format:

Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity (HANPP) by Country 
and Product (74 KB, zip file)
- The file name is HANPP_Intermediate_by_type_1nov06.xls
